<strong>Caner Korkmaz</strong> is a PhD student in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London in the CIRCLE Group.  Previously, he obtained an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge with the research thesis "Stable 3D Diffusion: Text-to-3D Shape using Latent Point Diffusion Models". Before that, he obtained Computer Engineering and Mathematics degrees at Ko√ß University. During these, he obtained industry experience in applying deep learning to the construction and medical healthcare sectors. His research interests focus on computer vision, generative deep learning, and topological data analysis in/with deep learning and theoretical aspects of deep learning, currently focused on the generalization gap of neural networks and integration of topological data analysis into deep learning.
