As a <strong>computer scientist</strong> and PI of the CIRCLE group, I strive to understand visual perception and build machines that can see. To do so, I leverage tools from differential geometry and algebraic topology, in conjunction with deep neural networks. My research focuses on:

<ul>
  <li>3D Computer Vision</li>
  <li>3D/4D Generative Priors</li>
  <li>Geometric/Topological Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Statistical and Topological Learning Theory</li>
  <li>Quantum Computer Vision</li>
</ul>

As a <strong>science advocate</strong>, I am committed to breaking down barriers to education, making knowledge accessible to allâ€”especially those from underrepresented and underprivileged communities. Through initiatives like <a href='https://bilimler.org'>Bilimler Koyu</a> and <a href='https://nesinkoyleri.org/en/main-page/nesin-maths-village/'>Nesin Maths Village</a>, I actively contribute to this mission. I envision the possibility of an alternative, transformative academia. #baskabirakademimumkun

As an <strong>entrepreneur</strong>, I have co-founded multiple startups, including <a href='https://www.befunky.com'>BeFunky</a>, an online photo editing platform that empowers creativity worldwide.

As a <strong>music aficionado</strong>, I am immersed into drums & percussion. I particularly appreciate blues, jazz, funk as well as folk, ethnic and experimental forms of rhythm and music holistically.
