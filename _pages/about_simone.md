<strong>Simone Foti</strong> is a Postdoctoral Researcher. Previously, he was at University College London, and had internship experience at Disney Research Studios and Adobe Research. His research interest lies at the intersection of geometric deep learning, computer graphics, and computer vision. His main goal is to improve 3D generative models to democratise the creation of 3D assets for applications in AR/VR, the metaverse, the movie and game production, and in plastic surgery. He strives to understand how to solve problems in non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and meshes and is currently working on multiple projects ranging from shape and texture generation, latent disentanglement, mesh sampling, and 3D reconstruction.
