<strong>Simone Foti</strong> is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. Previously, he obtained a PhD at the University College London (UCL) by researching "Latent Disentanglement for the Analysis and Generation of Digital Human Shapes", which found applications in computer vision, graphics and plastic surgery. During the PhD, he gained industry experience as a Research Scientist Intern at Disney Research Studios (Zurich) and Adobe Research (Paris). Simone also obtained an MRes in Medical Imaging from UCL, an MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, and a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Trieste. 
Currently, his research interest lies at the intersection of geometric deep learning, computer graphics, and computer vision. Through his research, Simone strives to understand how to solve problems in non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and meshes. He is currently working on multiple projects ranging from shape and texture generation, latent disentanglement, mesh sampling, and 3D reconstruction.
