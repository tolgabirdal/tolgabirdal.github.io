These will ultimately be used in applications such as self-driving cars, life sciences, 3D imaging, CAD modelling, and medical imaging."},{"title":"Young Professional Award","date":"2016-06","awarder":"European Machine Vision Association (EMVA)","url":"https://www.imveurope.com/news/emva-young-professional-award-given-new-approach-3d-digitisation","summary":"Birdal's work proposes reconstruction-via-detection framework, a new and effective approach to 3D digitisation from a limited number of unordered and unstructured 3D point clouds. The new method sets itself apart from other 3D systems due to its ability to integrate the CAD model – available in a wide range of industrial applications – directly into the reconstruction pipeline."}],"languages":[{"language":"Turkish","fluency":"Native","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"German","fluency":"Intermediate","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Computer Vision","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["3D Vision","Topological Deep Learning","Geometric Computing","Deep Learning Theory","Quantum Computer Vision"]}]}
